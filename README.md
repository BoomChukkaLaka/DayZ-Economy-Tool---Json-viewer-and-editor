# DayZ-Economy-Tool---Json-viewer-and-editor
A light browser tool that allows you to drag and drop Dayz Json files onto the screen and the browser will display an editable table that allows you to edit values, add rows and new data then export the files instantly in the required DayZ format - Works well currently, needs to be tested more tho
